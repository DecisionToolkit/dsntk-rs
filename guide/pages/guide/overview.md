# Overview

#DSNTK is a set of tools designed to build, test and evaluate decision models,
constructed basing on the [Decision Model and Notation](https://www.omg.org/dmn) ([DMN](https://www.omg.org/dmn)™)
specification, which is an industry standard governed by the [Object Management Group](https://www.omg.org) (OMG®).

#DSNTK aims to be performant, reliable, and fully compliant with the DMN™ specification,
ensuring accurate evaluation of decision models. All tools are implemented in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/),
a programming language known for its security, efficiency and reliability.

#DSNTK offers a range of features, including DMN™ models evaluation, decision tables evaluation,
and FEEL expressions evaluation. It also includes functionality for parsing, validating, and recognizing DMN™ models,
decision tables, and FEEL expressions. Users can test DMN™ models, decision tables, and FEEL expressions,
and export them to HTML.
