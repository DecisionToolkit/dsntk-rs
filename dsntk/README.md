## Overview

**Decision Toolkit** (or shortly **DSNTK**) is a suite of tools designed to build, evaluate, and test decision models.

**DSNTK** is constructed based on the [Decision Model and Notation (DMN™)](https://www.omg.org/dmn/)
specification, which is an industry standard governed by the [Object Management Group (OMG®)](https://www.omg.org/).

**DSNTK** aims to be performant, reliable, and fully compliant with the [DMN™](https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN) specification,
ensuring accurate evaluation of decision models. All tools are implemented in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/),
a programming language known for its security, efficiency and reliability.

**DSNTK** offers a range of features, including DMN model evaluation, decision table evaluation, and FEEL expression evaluation.
It also includes functionality for parsing, validating, and recognizing DMN models, decision tables, and FEEL expressions.
Users can test DMN models, decision tables, and FEEL expressions, and export them to HTML format.

**DSNTK** provides a comprehensive set of tools for decision model evaluation and testing,
leveraging the [DMN™](https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN) specification and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language
to ensure high performance, reliability and portability.
