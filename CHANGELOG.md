## [v0.0.8](https://github.com/DecisionToolkit/dsntk-rs/tree/v0.0.8) (2024-09-18)

### What's new

Validation of the DMN model was too strict, rejecting DMN 1.3 conformant models,
especially the ones generated by [Camunda](https://bpmn.io/) tools. This is fixed
and now executing Camunda models should work properly. If you find any other cases
that do not work, please [file an issue](https://github.com/DecisionToolkit/dsntk-rs/issues).
